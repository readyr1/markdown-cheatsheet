### Code Block
There are three ways to add code in markdown
1. Inline Code (single backtick)
1. Whitespace (Four Spaces Indentation)
1. Fenced Code Block (Three Backticks *or* Tildes)

#### Syntax
    `this` is an example of inline code.
    
    '''
    console.log('Used backticks to show snippets')
    '''
    
    console.log('four whitespace works too!')
    
    
#### Appearance
`this` is an example of inline code.
```
console.log('Used backticks to show snippets')
```
    console.log('four whitespace works too!')
    

### Syntax Highlighting
If language name is mentioned after the end of first set of backticks, the code snippet will be highlighted according to the language.

#### Syntax
    ```js
    console.log('javascript')
    ```
    
    ```python
    print('python')
    ```
    
    ```java
    System.out.println('java')
    ```
       
    ```json
    {
      "firstName": "Kaushal",
      "lastName": "Joshi
      "age": 18
    }
    ```



#### Appearance 
```js
console.log('javascript')

  "age": 18
}
```
####Emphasis
```
*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_
